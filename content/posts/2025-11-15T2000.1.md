# Welcome to BitBlog! 🚀

Introducing **BitBlog** - a simple, powerful, and developer-friendly blogging system built with PHP. If you're looking for a lightweight alternative to complex CMS platforms, you've come to the right place.

## Why BitBlog?

After years of dealing with bloated content management systems, database migrations, and complex setups, I wanted something different. Something **simple**. Something that puts **content first**.

BitBlog is built on a few core principles:

- **File-based storage**: Your posts are just Markdown files. No database headaches, easy backups, and version control friendly.
- **Developer-friendly**: Built-in VS Code editor integration for writing posts, clean code structure, and extensive customization options.
- **No compromises**: Despite being lightweight, BitBlog includes all the features you need - admin panel, multilingual support, RSS feeds, tag system, and more.
- **Deploy anywhere**: Just PHP 7.4+ required. Works on shared hosting, VPS, or even PHP's built-in server for local development.

## Features at a Glance

✨ **Write in Markdown** - Focus on content, not formatting  
🎨 **Built-in Editor** - Powered by VS Code for a familiar writing experience  
🌍 **Multilingual** - English and German included, easily add more  
🏷️ **Smart Organization** - Tag system with tag clouds for easy navigation  
📱 **Responsive Design** - Looks great on all devices  
🔒 **Secure by Default** - bcrypt passwords, CSRF protection, secure sessions  
⚡ **Fast** - Cached index for lightning-quick page loads  
📡 **RSS & Sitemap** - Keep your readers and search engines happy  

## Getting Started

Setting up BitBlog is incredibly simple:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jurgen178/bitblog.git
cd bitblog

# Start the development server
php -S localhost:8000

# Visit http://localhost:8000 and enjoy!
```

The first time you access the admin panel, you'll be guided through a quick setup wizard. That's it!

## What Makes It Different?

**Simplicity without sacrifice.** BitBlog doesn't try to be everything to everyone. It's focused on doing one thing really well: helping you publish and manage your blog with minimal friction.

- No complex plugin ecosystem to navigate
- No database to configure or maintain
- No heavy JavaScript frameworks
- Just clean, straightforward PHP and Markdown

**Developer experience matters.** Writing posts in VS Code (or any editor) with proper syntax highlighting, version control integration, and preview capabilities makes blogging feel like coding - in the best way possible.

## Perfect For

- **Personal blogs** - Share your thoughts without the overhead
- **Developer blogs** - Version control your posts with Git
